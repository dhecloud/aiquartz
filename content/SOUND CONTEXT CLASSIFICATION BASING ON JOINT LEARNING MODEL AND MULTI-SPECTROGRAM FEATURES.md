# Main Contribution(s)
Problem: No research has analyzed and indicated the most effective combination of spectrograms so far
Solution: Try out different combinations of low level features
# Summary
![[Pasted image 20210531231414.png]]
Combinations of low level features work better. [[Constant-Q-transform]] and [[Mel Spectrograms]] work best together. Benefit diminishes the more and more spectrograms are added together.
