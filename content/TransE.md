### [[Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Explainable AI]]
![[Pasted image 20201228192057.png]]Used to make [[Knowledge Graphs Embeddings]]. Uses k-dimensional vectors to represent both entities and relationships. A distance metric is used, either the [[Manhattan Distance]] or the [[Euclidean Distance]], to calculate $d(h+r,t)$ which is the distance between the head, relation, tail. Specifically, the full loss function is $$\mathscr{L} = \sum_{h,r,t \in S}\sum_{h^\prime, r^\prime, t^\prime \in S^\prime_{h,r,t}} [\gamma + d(h+r,t) - d(h^\prime+r,t^\prime)]_+$$ where $[x]_+$ is the positive part of x and $\gamma$ is a margin hyper-parameter, and $S^\prime_{h,r,t}$ is the set of corrupted triples. The set of corrupted triples are from a method called [[KBGAN]] which is part of [[Adversarial Learning]]
