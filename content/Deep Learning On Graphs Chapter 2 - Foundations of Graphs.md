# Foundations of Graphs

### Graph Representations
[[Simple Graph]]
[[Adjacency Matrix]] 
[[Degree]] 
[[Neighbors]]

### Connectivity
[[Walk]]
- [[Trail]] 
- [[Path]] 

For a graph with [[Adjacency Matrix]] $A$, $A^n$ is used to denote the *n-th power* of the adjacency matrix. The *i, j-th* element of the matric $A^n$ equals to the number of $v_i - v_j$ walks of length n.

[[Subgraph]]
[[Connected Component]] 
[[Shortest Path]]
[[Diameter]]

### Centrality
[[Degree Centrality]]
[[Eigenvector Centrality]]
[[Katz Centrality]]
[[Betweenness Centrality]]

### [[Spectral Graph Theory]]
[[Laplacian Matrix]] 

### Graph Signal Processing

[[Graph Signal]] 
[[Graph Fourier Transform]]
[[Inverse Graph Fourier Transform]]

Like a typical signal, the [[Graph Signal]] can be denoted in the spatial domain and spectral domain.

### Complex Graphs
Other types of graphs which are more complicated and popular

[[Heterogeneous Graphs]]
[[Bipartite Graphs]]
[[Multi-dimensional Graphs]]
[[Signed Graphs]] 
[[Hypergraphs]] 
[[Dynamic Graphs]]
[[Discrete Dynamic Graphs]]

### Computational Tasks
[[Node Classification]] - to classify each node
[[Link Prediction]] - Predict edges that most likely exist.
[[Graph Classification]] - to classify a whole graph.
- example: classify a whole protein graph structure as a type of protein
