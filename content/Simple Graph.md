denoted as $G=\{V,E\}$ where $V = \{v_1,...,v_N\}$ is a set of $|V|$ nodes and $E=\{e_1,...,e_M\}$ is a set of $M$ edges.

For a graph, its total [[Degree]] is twice the number of edges in the graph.
- Follows that the number of non-zero elements in the [[Adjacency Matrix]] is also twice the number of the edges
