### [[Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Explainable AI]]
#### Definition 
![[Pasted image 20201228185847.png]]
Refers to the vector representation of the elements that form [[Knowledge Graphs]]. Usually with low dimensionality, from 100-1000 dimensions.
#### Limitations
Results are sometime more influenced by training epochs than from actual model complexity. More research is needed to verify the impact of hyperparameters and loss functions. [[Knowledge Graphs Embeddings]] models for [[Link Prediction]] are uncalibrated; especially when thresholds needs to be defined.
