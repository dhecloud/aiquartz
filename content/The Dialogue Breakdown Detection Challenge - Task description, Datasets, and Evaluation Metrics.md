# Main Contribution(s)

# Summary
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPaperReadings%2FAJ58lBmGF8.png?alt=media&token=1bb41d1d-f3ad-4862-bed3-b4ddb8a46cba)
- 1146 text chat dialogues in Japanese
- 3 breakdown labels:
- ==(NB) Not a breakdown==
- ==(PB) Possible breakdown==
- ==(B) Breakdown==
- Evaluation metrics
- Classification-related: [[Accuracy]], [[Precision]], [[Recall]], [[F-scores]]
- Distribution-related: [[Jensen-Shannon Divergence]], [[Mean Squared Error]]
# Learning Gaps
- Most of the approaches here were done in 2015, so i guess the baselines are pretty much obsolete
# Simplify/Analogies
- Dataset to mitigate the dialogue breakdown problem.
