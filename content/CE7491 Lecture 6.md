- [[Region Proposal Network]]
- [[Faster R-CNN]] is a two stage object detector
- Run backbone network and region proposal network per image
- Crop features, predict object class, prediction bbox offset per region
- [[Image Restoration]]
- [[Super-Resolution]]
- produce a detailed realistic output image which is faithful to the low resolution image
- Allows for saving bandwidth
- Single image up-scaling is ill posed because there exists infinite high resolutions solutions for that low resolution image
- Example based methods learn mapping functions from external low and high resolution exemplar pairs
- [[Deconvolution (Transposed Convolution)]] same as normal convolution but in the backward direction (smaller to bigger dimension)
- Causes "checkerboard" artifacts in the upsampled image due to the uneven overlap when the kernel size is not divisible by the stride.
- Solve this by doing a convolution after a deconvolution, or doing a subpixel convolution
- [[Generative Adversarial Network]]
