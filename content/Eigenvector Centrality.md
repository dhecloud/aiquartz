calculates the centrality scores by getting the largest [[Eigenvalue]] and [[Eigenvector]]. Specifically, $$\lambda \cdot c_e = A \cdot c_e$$ where $c_e$ is an eigenvector of the [[Adjacency Matrix]] $A$ with its corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$. Because of the [[Perronâ€“Frobenius Theorem]], a real squared matrix has a unique largest [[Eigenvalue]] and its corresponding [[Eigenvector]] has all positive elements. Therefore the largest eigenvalue is chosen as $\lambda$ and its corresponding eigenvector will be the centrality score vector.
