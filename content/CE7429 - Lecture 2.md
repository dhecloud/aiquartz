- [[Computational Intelligence]] is a branch of science dealing with problems that cannot be solved using effective computational algorithms and we focus on human-brain inspired approaches using a repertoire of AI or ML tools to achieve human-like, interpretable decision process
- Biological inspirations help to formulate initial models: Neural networks design architecture
- Psychological inspirations in the form of larger brain structures are considered (connectionist models) 
- Bio-medical inspirations: Swarm Algorithms, Immunological systems, etc
- Logic inspirations: Fuzzy, Crisp, Rough logic
