[[Auto-Encoders]] have been extended to graph structured data for node [[Representation learning]]. There are two types of [[Graph Auto-Encoders]] for learning low dimensional node reprsentations. 

[[Tree-LSTM]] tries to generalize the [[LSTM]] to tree-structured data, and likewise for [[Graph-LSTM]] for graph-structured data.

The [[GCN-Filter]] is also used as the [[Graph Neural Networks|GNN]] to build the inference model for [[Variational Auto-Encoder]] for graphs. There are different tasks, such as [[Variational Auto-Encoder]] for graph generation, [[Representation learning]]. Skimmed through most of it.

[[Generative Adversarial Network]] is also used for [[Representation learning]]. Instead of simply a generator and discriminator, there is also a judge, which measure how good a generated graph is. Skimmed through most of it.
