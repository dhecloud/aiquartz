[[Symmetric]] matrices
- $$A = A^T$$
- Always [[Orthogonality|orthogonally]] [[Diagonalisable]]

[[Spectral Theorem]]: An $n \times n$ [[Symmetric]] matrix $A$ has the following properties:
- A has __n__ real [[Eigenvalue]]s if we count multiplicity
- For each [[Eigenvalue]], corresponding [[Eigen Space]] is equal to the [[Algebraic Multiplicity]] of that eigenvalue

[[Eigen Space]]s are mutually [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]]
$A$ is [[Orthogonality|orthogonally]] [[Diagonalisable]]
[[Similar]] Matrices
- if $A$ and $B$ are square matrices, then $B$ is similar to A if there is an invertible matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP$


[[Similarity Transform]]
$$A \rightarrow P^{-1}AP$$
- Preserves many properties of the matrix $$A$$
- These preserved properties are said to be [[Similarity Invariant]]

- We can use [[Eigendecomposition]] to do this.
