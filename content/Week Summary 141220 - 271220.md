## Paper of the Week
[[Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks]]
Quite a insightful paper, which raises questions about an architecture tendency to induce inductive biases.
## Honorable Mentions
[[Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering]]
introduces the [[Graph Convolutional Network|GCN]] which became a staple in [[Graph Neural Networks|GNN]] research.
