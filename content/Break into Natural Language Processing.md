- [[Łukasz Kaiser]]'s segment
- Spoke about [[Transformer]]s and [[GPT-2]]
- Trends:
- 1. Long sequences
- 2. More inference ability
- 3. Few-shot Learning
- 4. New use-cases
- [[Andrew Ng]]'s segment
- Rise of AI is leading to specialization: NLP, CV, medical imaging, speech, etc
- NLP is still trending
- Applications of NLP: 
- **Today**:Search, summarization, complete, anti-spam, machine translation, smart speakers/assistants, chatbots
- **Future**: Education, Email tools, synthesize academic papers, flexible robotic process automation, etc
- Unsupervised learning
- Learning from large amount of unlabeled data
- Translate to other (usually supervised) task
- Panel discussion
- [[Andrew Ng]]: Timing for NLP to flourish seems to be better than before
- [[Kenneth Church]]: Raises point that it might not be a good time to get into NLP, should wait for next big time
- [[Łukasz Kaiser]] disagrees, says social media makes NLP world seems larger than it is, and there are many unexplored areas like few shot learning in [[GPT-3]]
- [[Younes Bensouda Mourri]] thinks that model distillation to replicate the performance of bigger models is more practical than calling a [[GPT-3]] API
