- Extending Education
- [[Natural Language Processing]] to have unstructured conversations with students. [[Conversational Dialogue Systems]]
- [[Facial Recognition]] to detect emotions, identify students
- [[Augmented Reality]], [[Virtual Reality]] for simulations, training
- Motion sensors, bio-metric sensors, eye-tracking
- Robots as pedagogical agents, social emotional learning, learning to program robots, helping teachers 
- Supporting teachers in classroom

- Challenge 2: Ineffective forms of interaction with AI in learning analytics
- Challenge 3: Validity - Progression
- AI to automate coding of discourse
- Theory-driven us of AI is great, but is it usable
- AI to identify constructs that matter: 
- Automated detection of learning and time management
- Explainable learning strategies that predict learning success
- Generate feedback from data
