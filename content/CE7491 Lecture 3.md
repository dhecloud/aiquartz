- [[Spectral Power Distribution]]
- Plot of power against wavelight 
- Grayscale cameras only have one response function
- Color sensation is a simplified human representation. Different [[Spectral Power Distribution]] can generate the same color sensation
- [[Quantitative Color Specification]]
- Names are very inexact; bright green, pink, dark brown
- Specify [[Spectral Power Distribution]] -> exact color, but too much redundant information
- Black-Body temperature
- [[Tristimulus Color Theory]]
- A gamut of colors can be humanly perceived by physically adding 3 primary [[Spectral Power Distribution]] in different amounts
- [[Grassmann's Law]] states that human perception of color mixing is linear
- **No** set of 3 physically real primary [[Spectral Power Distribution]] can reproduce all perceptible colors additively 
- [[Luminance]]
- The approximate radiance
- [[Chromaticity]]
- Colors with the same ratio of [[Tristimulus Values]] have the same chromaticity 
- [[Subtractive Color Mixing]]
- Uses color codes like CMYK 
- Detection of Edges
- [[Sobel Gradient]]
- [[Laplacian of Gaussian Filter]]
- [[Canny Edge Detector]]
    1. Gaussian Edge Filtering
    2. [[Non-maximal Suppression]]
- Reduce smeared edges to single pixel wide paths
    3. [[Hysteresis Thresholding]]
- High threshold - used as in normal thresholding
- Low thresholds - pixels with magnitudes between two thresholds may be set to 1 if neighboring pixels perpendicular to edge gradient have been set to 1
- [[Hough Transform]]
- Grouping straight image edges that belong to the same physical edge in the world
- Origin of image is typically taken to be the centre of the image
- Can connect lines or circles which are broken up either by noise or occlusion
