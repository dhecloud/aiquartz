![[Pasted image 20201215215447.png]] Two graphs exhibit [[Isomorphism]] if there exists an index permutation between the nodes that preserves node adjacencies
Determining if two graphs are isomorphic is [[NP-Intermediate]].
[[Weisfieler-Lehman test]] was proposed to test isomorphic. However, it is a neccesary test and **not a sufficient test** for graph isomorphism.
