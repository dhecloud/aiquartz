## Paper of the Week
[[Mask-Predict]]
- I felt this was a pretty simple yet straightforward method without needing any convoluted systems
## Honorable Mentions
[[Insertion Transformer]]
## Shame and Blame
[[KERMIT - Generative Insertion-Based Modeling for Sequences]]
- Not that the research is bad, but i think the paper was badly written!
