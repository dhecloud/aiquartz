# Main Contribution(s)
- Proposes a new interpolation model, the [[Kernel CMAC (Architecture)]]
# Summary
- Takes inspiration from the kernel trick of the [[Subject Vector Machines]]. The association vector of a CMAC corresponds to the feature space representation of a kernel machine.
- Weight Smoothing regularization is also applied to improve generalization.
- Allows for online learning using batched learning.
