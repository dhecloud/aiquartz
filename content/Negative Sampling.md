Inspired by [[Noise Contrasitive Estimation (NCE)]] which approximately maximizes the log probability of the [[Softmax]], [[Negative Sampling]] samples $k$ nodes that do not appear in the context window of the center node. The objective function is $$\text{log } \sigma(f_{con}(v_{con})^Tf_{cen}(v_{cen})) + \sum_{i=1}^k E_{v_n \sim P_n(v)}[\text{log} \sigma (-f_{con}(v_n)^Tf_{cen}(v_{cen}))]$$ where $P_n(v)$ is the noise distribution to sample teh negative tuples. By maximizing the objective function, the nodes in true tuples are maximized and the nodes in the negative are minimized.
- In the matrix form, [[DeepWalk]] with [[Negative Sampling]] is equivalent to factoring the following matrix $$\log(\frac{\text{vol}(G)}{T})(\sum_{r=1}^{T}P^r)D^{-1})$$
