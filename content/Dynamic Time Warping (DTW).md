$$\text{dis}(a,b) = \frac{\max(a,b)}{\min(a,b)} -1$$
Finds the optimal alginment between two sequences such that the sum of the distance between the algined elements is minimized.

Note that this distance depends on the ratio between the maximum and minimum of the two elements; thus, it can regard (1, 2) much different from (100, 101).
