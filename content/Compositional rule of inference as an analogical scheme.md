# Main Contribution(s)
- Discusses [[Fuzzy Deductive Reasoning]] achieved through the [[Compositional Rule of Inference]] from the analogy point of view
#  Summary
-  An [[Analogical Scheme]] is a mapping such that for $$R_{\beta R_XR_Y} : [0, 1]^X × [0, 1]^Y × [0, 1]^X → [0, 1]^Y$$ where $$\beta \subset [0,1]^X \times [0,1]^Y,  R_x \subset [0,1]^X \times [0,1]^X$$  and $$R_y \subset [0,1]^Y \times [0,1]^Y$$
- These properties must be fulfiled:
            1. (AS1) $$B = R_{\beta R_x R_y}(A,B,A)$$
            2. (AS2) and for each $$A^\prime \in [0,1]^X$$ and such that $$AR_XA^\prime, B^\prime = R_{\beta R_XR_Y}(A,B,A^\prime)$$ satisfies $$A^\prime \beta B^\prime$$ and $$BR_YB^\prime$$
- Intuition: 
$$\beta$$ is a relation that operates on universe $$X$$ and $$Y$$ eg a relation between ages and heights
$$R_X$$ is a relation that operates on a statement with premise and consequence in the same domain $$X$$ eg a relation evaluating the similarity between ages
$$R_Y$$ is a relation operates on a statement with premise and consequence in the same domain $$Y$$ eg a relation evaluating the similarity between heights
#  Analogical Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning
- Analogical reasoning uses similarities to obtain a result
- Deductive reasoning using a premise to obtain a result
- [[Modus Ponens]]: an Implication, a deductive argument form. 
- P implies Q & P is true, therefore Q must be true. 
#  [[Compositional Rule of Inference]]
- $$A\beta B$$ where $$\beta$$ is a link between fuzzy descriptions of $$V$$ and $$W$$ if and only if if one of the following conditions is satisfied
            1. there is an object of $$G$$ attached to a value of $$V$$ equal to $$A$$ and a value of $$W$$ equal to $$B$$
            2. there exists $$j$$ such that $$A = A_j$$ and $$B = B_j$$

# Learning Gaps/Thoughts
- Kinda glossed over the proofs, needs more knowledge about tnorms and supports
# Simplify/Analogies
