## Week in Review
[[Breaking the Softmax Bottleneck - A High-Rank RNN Language Model]] (not in notes)
[[Poor Man's BERT - Smaller and Faster Transformer Models]]
[[Semi Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation]]
[[A Study of Non-autoregressive Model for Sequence Generation]]
[[Fine-Tuning by Curriculum Learning for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation]]
[[Guiding Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation Decoding with Reordering Information]]
## Paper of the Week
None. All were pretty meh without any mind-blowing insights
## Honorable Mentions
[[Breaking the Softmax Bottleneck - A High-Rank RNN Language Model]]
Pretty interesting paper, and one that i agree with. [[Softmax]] is too constrained to full express language
## Shame and Blame
None!
