URL: [\[1904.03543\] Spatio-Temporal Attention Pooling for Audio Scene Classification (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03543)
# Main Contribution(s)
Problem: Acoustic scene typically contain lots of redundant information
Solution: Apply spatial attention on the feature dimension, along with temporal soft attention.
# Summary
Learn two attention vecctors for spatial and temporal
![[Pasted image 20210601193957.png]] Results on the [[LITIS-Rouen dataset]]. Slightly outperforms, not signficantly.
# Learning Gaps/Thoughts
Interesting research
Augmentation for other modalities still requires expertise 
# Simplify/Analogies
