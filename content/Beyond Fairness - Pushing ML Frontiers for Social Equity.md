- How does fairness relate to [[Mechanism Design for Social Good]], and how to formulate a problem for fairness?
    - [[Irene Lo]]: Most research geared towards profit, for example ad auctions. How to shift this? There is this idea where for something to be great research it has to have a novel technical component 
    - [[Rediet Abebe]]: There is a concentration of power around ML, issues of representation in academia because of social backgrounds
- [[Augustin Chaintreau]]: Looking back at mechanism of growth allowed them to understand and differentiate between organic growth and algorithmic growth
- How much does out of domain expertise apply to ML
    - [[Rediet Abebe]]: Took graduate level sociology classes; learnt stuff across domain which you did not know you needed. Thinks multilingual (of different disciplines)/diverse background is indeed needed. [[Irene Lo]] agrees, learning the research language of other disciplines are especially important.
    - [[Augustin Chaintreau]]: Thinks interdisciplinary work should not only be published at major AI conferences, and it is especially important to nurture other disciplines
- Why are constraints that pop up in real world applications often not thought about in academic research
    - [[Irene Lo]]: If a model is too constrained due to specific problems, it is often not as impactful and general. It is also really hard to model
- What are the disincentives to discussing these problems
    - [[Augustin Chaintreau]]: There needs to be a massive shift of attitudes in tech research from a "other fields should be discussing about our impacts and tech is always good" mindset to a more mindful and considerable attitude. 
    - [[Mary Gray]]: Most PHD students do not have to time to learn about other domains and their disciplines due to the time taken, and it is on the tenure board to make sure to slow things down for students to be able to actually talk to people
- How do we decide if an algorithm should try to match the real world distribution and when it should stay status quo
    - [[Augustin Chaintreau]]: Speak to a domain expert, decide how to tackle each bias
    - [[Irene Lo]]: Bringing more experts and people to get a larger picture is always beneficial
