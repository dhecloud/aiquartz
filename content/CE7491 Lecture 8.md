- [[Image-to-Image Translation]]
- [[Deep Fakes]] - realistic images; manipulating physical attributes into those not previously observed before. But this does not include CGI, so must include an element of ease and convenience
- Tries to make 2 [[Auto-Encoders]] the same by sharing the weights of the encoder.
- [[Latent Space]], a compact representation of relevant information, of a [[Neural Network]] tends to self-organize. 
- Desired [[Properties]]
- Compact
- Invariant
- Disentangled (relevant features as represented separately in different feature spaces)
- [[Auto-Encoders]]
- Intended separation by bottlenecking
- [[Generative Adversarial Network]]
- Dealing with __instance__ discriminator
- Ideally should converge to the globally minimal [[Nash Equilibrium]]
- Suboptimal [[Nash Equilibrium]] = [[Mode Collapse]]
- ==Is the image a likely fair sample from the underlying real data distribution?==, NOT to give u the most realistic image
- This is because is an instance discriminator
- [[Task Regularization]]
