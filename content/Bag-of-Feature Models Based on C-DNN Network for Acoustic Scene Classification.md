# Main Contribution(s)
Problem: Gains from literature are mostly from complex architectures
Solution: Investigate input features using [[Bag of Features]]
# Summary
![[Pasted image 20210531234445.png]]
Several approaches:
1. Bag of Channels - does not improve accuracy very significantly
2. Bag of Feature size - no signficant improvement, but ensemble does perform slightly better
3. Bag of spectrogram - best improvement
