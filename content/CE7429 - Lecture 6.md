- [[Principal Component Analysis]] problem
- Gives worst possible solution from the point of view of seeing the structure of the data
- Finds the most accurate data representation in a lower dimension
- Completely unsupervised, knows only about variance, but nothing about different classes of data
- [[Discriminant Component Analysis]]
- [[Fisher's Discriminant Analysis]]
- [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]]
- explicitly attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. [[Principal Component Analysis]], in contrast, does not take into account any difference in class, and factor analysis builds the feature combinations based on differences rather than similarities
- find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
