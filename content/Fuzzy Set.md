- A pair $$(U, m)$$ where $$U$$ is a set and $$m:U \rightarrow [0,1]$$ a membership function
- The value $$m(x)$$ is called the grade of membership of $$x$$. 
- The function $$m = \mu_A$$ is called the membership function of the fuzzy set $$A = (U,m)$$
- [[T-norm]] on a pair of fuzzy sets is the same as the intersection
- [[T-conorm]] on a pair of fuzzy sets is the same as the union.
