# Summary

- The goal of [[MultiWOZ 1.0]] was to collect multi-domain dialogue. The main goal was to acquire highly natural conversations between a tourist and a clerk from an information center in a touristic city.
- There are 7 domains: Attraction, Hospital, Police, Hotel, Restaurant, Taxi, Train
- Latter 4 include sub-task Booking

- There are three subtasks for the [[Dialogue Modelling]] task
- 1. Dialogue State Tracking
- 2. Dialogue Act-to-Text Generation
- 3. Dialogue Context-to-Text Generation.

- Compared to the [[SFX restaurant]] dataset, it is a lot more challenging BLEU-wise on a SC-LSTM
# Learning Gaps
- I guess most of the dialogue terms i'm pretty new
# Simplify/Analogies
- A new dataset aimed at multi-dialogue conversation.
