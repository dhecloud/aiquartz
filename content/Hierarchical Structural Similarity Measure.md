used to quantify [[Structural Role]] in a graph. $R_k(v)$ is the set of nodes $k$-hop away from node $v$. Then, $R_k(v)$ is ordered according to their degree to form $s(R_k(v))$. The structural distance is measured as $$g_k(v_1,v_2) = g_{k-1}(v_1,v_2) + \text{dis}(s(R_k(v_1)),s(R_k(v_2)))$$ The larger the distance, the more dissimilar the two compared inputs. [[Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)]] is used as the distance function as it can deal with sequences with difference sizes.
